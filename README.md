# MCreator-Tutorials
The objective of this repository is to contain all MCreator workspaces I use when I'm making tutorials. You can download, re-use and re-distribute them. However, if you could simply link to this repository when re-distributing it, I would appreciate. :)

# How to use
To use a workspace, simply download the ZIP file and then, import it inside MCreator like normally. Just be careful to use the appropriate minimal version, so you don't get problems.
